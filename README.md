Solution - 
The solution should provide effictive way to identify the fraud claims so that other claims can be cleared rapidly while identified cases can be scrutinized in detail.

1.3 Description of Variables :

0-Areas of service :
    There are 7 areas of services where data on hospital facilities are collected
1-Hospital County :
    There are certain counties in each area where the hospital services are provided
2-Hospital Id :
    In each county, there are various types of hospitals with different Id numbers
3-Age :
    There are patients of different age groups starting from 0 to 70 years and older. This includes newborn baby as well
4-Gender: Male/ Female
5-Cultural Group :
    Different Cultural Groups like
    - Black are called as African Americans.
    - White who are white American
    - Other Race – Groups other than the above two
6-Ethnicity :
    Spanish/Hispanic: Spanish speaking countries especially people from Central and South America
    Non-Spanish: Main English speaking countries called Anglo Americans
7-No. of Days Spent in Hospital:
    The average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) is often used as an indicator of efficiency. All other things being equal, a shorter stay will reduce the cost per       discharge and shift care from inpatient to less expensive post-acute settings. The ALOS refers to the average number of days that patients spend in the hospital.       It is generally measured by dividing the total number of days stayed by all inpatients during a year by the number of admissions or discharges. Day cases are           excluded. The indicator is presented both for all acute care cases and for childbirth without complications.
8-Admission Type :
    Code: Code value
      1 Emergency: The patient requires immediate medical intervenetion as a result of severe, life-threatening, or potentially disabling conditions. Generally, the            patient is admitted through the emergency room.
      2 Urgent: The patient requires immediate attention for the care and treatment of a physical or mental disorder. Generally, the patient is admitted to the first            available and suitable accommodation.
      3 Elective: The patient’s condition permits adequate time to schedule the availability of suitable accommodation.
      4 Newborn: The patient is a newborn delivered either inside the admitting hospital (UB04 FL 15 value 5 [A baby born inside the admitting hospital] or outside of          the hospital (UB04 FL 15 value “6” [A baby born outside the admitting hospital]).
      5 Trauma: The patient visits a trauma center (A trauma center means a facility licensed or designated by the State or local government authority authorized to do          so, or as verified by the American College of surgeons and involving a trauma activation.)
        Null/missing source value is missing, unknown, or not on the valid value list or within the range of valid values

9-Home or Self Care, : Type of recommended care is covered under Home or Self-care

10-ccs diagnosis code:
    ccs diagnosis code is the code depending on the type of disease
11-ccs procedure code:
    ccs procedure code is the code for the recommended clinical procedures to be followed.
12-APR-DRG ( All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups are related to each other according to CCS(Clinical Classification Software) guideline attached.Apr-drg           description is the description of the disease
13-Illness Code :
    ● 0 for stage unspecified
    ● 1 for mild
    ● 2 for moderate
    ● 3 for severe
    ● 4 for indeterminate
14-Mortality Risk :
    ● 1 for Minor
    ● 2 for Moderate
    ● 3 for Major
    ● 4 for Severe
15-Surge_ Description – Type of Treatment – May be Surgical or Medical.

16-Weight_baby: Wherever the admission type is “New Born”, there will be some baby weight, otherwise it is 0.

17-Abortion (Y/N)
    Wherever there is a “newborn” as a type of admission, there is “N” for abortion. In all other cases, it is “Y”
18-Emergency_Deptt:
    An emergency department, also known as an accident & emergency department, emergency room, emergency ward, or casualty department, is a medical treatment facility     specializing in emergency medicine, the acute care of patients who present without a prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance.
    The patient admission type may or may not be an emergency, but during treatment, the case can be taken to the emergency dept.
19-Total Charges
    Think of a hospital as a hotel. A hotel has a price list and charges you for the room, internet service, food, and beverages. A hospital has a price list as well.     It is called a “Chargemaster” or Charge Description Master (CDM). It includes medical procedures, lab tests, supplies, medications, etc. A hospital charges for         every item used by a patient along with its associated charges (billed charges) on every claim submitted to an insurance carrier or patient.
    The billed charges for every item are the same for every payer so there is consistency. In most hospitals, billed charges only cover the hospital’s charges; they       do not cover many professional fees. For example, if you are seen in the Emergency Department by a physician that is part of an outsourced service you will receive     a separate bill for his/her service. If you need surgery you will also receive an invoice from the surgeon and the anesthesiologist or anesthetist.
20-Total Costs
    Hospital costs vary according to how much they must spend to provide patient care, as opposed to how much a patient or insurer must spend to receive care. The         hospital earns a surplus when they receive higher amounts than their costs. They incur a loss when the opposite occurs.
21-Cost–to-Charge Ratios & Their Relevance
    Hospitals typically compare their total charges to their cost using a cost-to-charge ratio determination.
    The cost-to-charge ratio is the ratio between a hospital’s expenses and what they charge. The closer the cost-to-charge ratio is to 1, the less difference there is     between the actual costs incurred and the hospital’s charges. Multiplying each hospital’s overall cost-to-charge ratio by total charges provides an estimate of the     hospital’s costs.
    The cost-to-charge ratio can be used to estimate the cost of some specific procedures or to compare hospital costs between different facilities in the same local       area or in other areas of the country.
